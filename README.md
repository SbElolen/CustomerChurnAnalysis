# CustomerChurnAnalysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company to identify key factors influencing customer retention. The dataset contains customer details, tenure, monthly charges, and churn status. The goal is to derive insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

# Key Insights
- Churn Rate: A significant portion of customers leave the company, requiring better retention strategies.
- Tenure Impact: Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
- Monthly Charges: Higher monthly charges correlate with higher churn rates.
- Senior Citizens: A small portion of customers are senior citizens, but their churn behavior differs.

# Visualizations & Findings
- Churn Distribution: Shows the proportion of customers who left vs stayed.
- Senior Citizen Analysis: Identifies whether senior citizens have different churn behavior.
- Tenure vs Churn: Reveals the relationship between customer duration and likelihood of leaving.
- Monthly Charges vs Churn: Highlights pricing effects on customer decisions.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas: Data processing and cleaning.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.

# Files Included
- `customer_churn_analysis.py` → Main analysis script.
- `cleaned_customer_churn.csv` → Processed dataset after cleaning.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`
3. Run the script: `python customer_churn_analysis.py`

# Future Improvements
- Implement a machine learning model to predict churn.
- Analyze additional factors like contract type and payment methods.
- Optimize retention strategies based on insights.
